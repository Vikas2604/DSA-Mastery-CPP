# 🚀 DSA Mastery in C++

This repository documents my complete journey to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms using C++**.  
It is organized **week by week** and **day by day**, covering everything from **C++ fundamentals** to advanced **DSA problems**.

---

## 📂 Structure
- `Week_X/C++/Day_Y` → C++ language learning (syntax, OOP, STL, etc.)
- `Week_X/Day_Y` → DSA problems (arrays, strings, recursion, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a solid foundation in **C++**
- Solve **DSA problems daily** with increasing difficulty
- Cover all major topics (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, DP, Advanced)
- Prepare for **coding interviews & competitive programming**

---

## 🛠️ How to Run
Compile and run any file using:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
